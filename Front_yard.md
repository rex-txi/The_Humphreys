## Gardening Goals and Layout for Front Yard:
- **Objective:** Enhance the historic charm of the Queen Anne Victorian home with a complementary native garden.

## Garden Design:
1. **Native Garden Design:** Suitable for full sun to partial shade, thriving in the east-facing yard.The garden design must include a native, naturalistic setting that respects the house's proportions and historical features, with tall grasses on the outer edges, mid-height flowering plants in the middle, and low ground covers near the house for afternoon shade tolerance. The garden should integrate seamlessly with the neighboring lush native garden to the north and enhance the home's historical character while supporting local ecology. The image should be centered, with the house and garden in full view, reflecting morning sunlight with appropriate shadow casting for an east-facing property.
2. **Layered Planting Structure:** 
   - Tall Grasses on the outer edges.
   - Mid-Height Plants in the middle.
   - Ground Covers near the house.

## Pollinator-Friendly Plants:
- Selections that attract and support local wildlife.

## Seasonal Interest:
- Plants chosen for year-round visual appeal.

## Alternative Yard Design Ideas:
1. **Cottage Garden:** An informal mix of perennials, annuals, herbs, and vines.
2. **Modern Minimalist Garden:** Structured plantings with a sleek, geometric design.
3. **Edible Garden:** Raised beds for vegetables and herbs with decorative flowering borders.

## Considerations for Sunlight:
- Plant placement based on sunlight needs, from full-sun lovers to shade-tolerant varieties.

## Explicit Note:
- These designs are intended for the front yard, considering the house's east-facing orientation and sunlight pattern.
